# TODO: unpredictable steps (e.g. recommenders) can have uuid U based on config as usual,

#  a corrective uuid X need to be appended, just like a final step F.
#  A * X = U      X = U / A
#  F can be called Alias, because it adds a new uuid for the same resulting data.
#  The only downside is that Cache cannot take advantage of a previously stored A, because it only nows U upfront.
#  A partial workaround is to keep a table of aliases (or just write two entries),
#  so at least when one have A they can look for a previously stored U.
